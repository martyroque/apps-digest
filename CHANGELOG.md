## [0.2.0] - 2023-02-17

### Changed

- Abstract the store definition generation to the store container by
adding a `getStoreDefinition` method to the store prototype, making it
simpler to just export the stores instead of manually generating the
store definition before exporting or using the store.

### Removed

## [0.1.0] - 2022-12-09

### Changed

- Update custom hooks to consume `useSyncExternalStore`.
- Generate unique store IDs upon store generation instead of the static `getStoreName` method, which could be prone to issues on refactors.

### Changed

- Fixed README examples and added a live demo.
- Removed the `apps_digest_flow.jpeg` image to reduce package size.

## [0.0.3] - 2022-08-18

### Added

- Added persistency feature to store values.

## [0.0.2] - 2022-06-04

  store constructable to enforce store name definition.

### Added

- Initial release.
